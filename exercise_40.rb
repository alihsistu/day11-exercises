# Exercise 40
# You will write a method, find_peaks(array), that accepts an array of integers
# The method should return an array containing all of "peaks" of the array.
# An element is considered a "peak" if it is greater than both it's left and right neighbour.
# The first or last element of the array is considered a "peak" if it is greater than it's one neighbour
# -----------------------------------
# 1 make a loop for the array
# 2 for each element compare it to the element to each sides
# 3 if element is bigger than rigth
# ------------------------------------
# Write Your method code here
def find_peaks(array)

    for i in 1..array.length - 1
        if i >  i-1 
            next
        elsif i > i
            return i
        end
    end
